   <div class="paragraph"> <p>Our phones have evolved significantly since Alexander Graham Bell first patened the telephone in 1876. The late 2000s and the early 2010s were a crucial time period for the growth of the internet and smart phones. Before smartphones were invented, the sole purpose of cell phones was to call, but now, we are able to listen to music, browse the internet, take photos, and so much more. The first iPhone was released in 2007, and the rest is history. I still remember getting my very first touch screen phone, and being amazed by the fact that I can now search things up on my phone instead of having to use my computer.<br> Click "History of phones" to go down memory lane or click "Buy your own today" to buy your very own cell phone! </p>
